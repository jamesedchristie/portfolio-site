# Portfolio Site for James Christie
## Stack
### React + Gatbsy + GraphQL + Tailwind CSSS

--- 

A pretty simple Gatsby site. The About page is completely static at the moment, while the Projects page hooks into the Gatsby GraphQL data layer and pulls in project metadata from the GitHub GraphQL API. Webhooks in my repos trigger site builds, and the readme files are transformed into their own pages.

### TODO

---

Add a blog. The integration with Prismic CMS is ready. Just need to find something worth writing about.

## Design
Decided on a pretty simple design and layout. Not entirely happy with it. About section is too dense. Had fun with the little animations though. Made the little planet/moon components with CSS - and then realised I'd pretty much ripped the Postman logo.

### TODO

---

Implement some nice scrolling transitions for the cards on each page. Maybe simplify the About section into a timeline.
